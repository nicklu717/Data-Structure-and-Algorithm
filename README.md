## How to Start
1. Execute `setup.sh` right after you cloned the project.
``` sh
$ ./setup.sh
```
2. You can edit `int main()` function in `main.cpp` as a playground. To run the result, execute the following commands:
``` sh
$ make main
$ ./main.out
```
3. If you want to run the tests:
``` sh
$ make tests
$ ./tests.out
```
